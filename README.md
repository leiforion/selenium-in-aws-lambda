# Using the GitHub repository directly

You need AWS SAM CLI installed and AWS credentials configured.

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the [repository](https://github.com/rehanhaider/selenium-in-aws-lambda).
```git
git clone https://github.com/rehanhaider/selenium-in-aws-lambda.git
```

NOTE: Selenium 4.0+ will generally break with the original repo- clone this repo for compatible earlier selenium version

Navigate to the app directory. 

```bash
cd selenium-in-aws-lambda/selenium
```

Build the app.

```bash
sam build
```

Test the app locally.

```bash
sam local invoke
```

Deploy the app to AWS.

```bash
sam deploy --guided
