# Run Selenium in AWS Lambda

Let me begin by expressing my frustration ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ with the fact that AWS doesn't have a pre-configured selenium image for Lambda on their public ECR marketplace. Selenium is the go-to tool for UI testing and for building many kinds of bots but running it on Lambda is complicated. 

The easiest method is, as [I explained earlier](0017-run-lambda-on-container-sam.md),  to to use Docker for Lambda to create an image with selenium, chrome / chromium headless and webdriver, but given the way Lambda restricts the environment making it work on selenium is quite difficult but not impossible.
